# Message-Passing-Interface 
Distributed System assignments

MPI or message passing interface  is a standardized means of exchanging messages between multiple computers running a parallel program across distributed memory.

There are 3 assignment questions that require to be solved in a distributed fashion using MPI. All the codes are in C++.

For compiling - `mpicc <filename>.cpp`

For running - `mpirun -np 12 ./a.out` where n is the number of processes

Refer the pdf for the questions

This is a nice resource to learn more about MPI - https://rookiehpc.org/mpi/index.html
